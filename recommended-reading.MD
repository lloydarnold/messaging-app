This project is built on the MEAN stack -- this is an open source stack (collection of platforms) that is often used
for web development. It has the advantage of being javascript on all levels, hopefully making understanding it a bit easier.
That said, it is a steep learning curve. This article helps try to make sense of it:

In the clientside controller, I had to dynamically add some angular elements. This was harder than one might reasonably
have expected, and took me a fair amount of time to work out. This article explains it well.
